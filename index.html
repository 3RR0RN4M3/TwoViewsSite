                <p>
                    Two Views is a 2-player local co-op puzzle solving game which is focused on visualizing the cause
                    and the solution for reducing generation gap. It communicates the message via the story between two
                    scientists, and the gameplay of shifting the
                    view and their special abelites for solving the puzzles. We hope this game will increase the
                    communication and relationship between children and parents.

                <p>
                    Two scientists are making a device to change the world, however the scientist thinks that their own
                    ideology is the best. Both tried to implement their idea into the machine and a space anomaly
                    occurs. Now they are trapped in a pocket dimension of their own and now they have to find a way to
                    escape.
